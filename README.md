# 2D Video Game

This project aims to develop a functional, single-screen game level by applying data structures and algorithms to manage game mechanics such as collision detection and image rendering.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a functional 2D game level using **Java**. The game level is a single-screen environment (no scrolling), where various objects interact with each other using custom-designed algorithms and data structures.

### Key Features
- **Single-Screen Level**: The game level is confined to a single screen, with no scrolling.
- **Java Collections**: Efficiently used Java collections such as `ArrayList`, `Stack`, or `Queue` to manage in-game data and handle dynamic elements.
- **Collision Detection**: Implemented a container structure to manage and check collisions between objects using bounding boxes.

## Development Objectives

### 1. Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Goal**: Use Javaâ€™s data structures to manage game objects, handle image rendering, and collision detection.
- **Java Collections**: 
  - `ArrayList`: For storing and managing game assets such as images and objects.
  - `Stack` or `Queue`: For game state management or other relevant use cases.
- **Evaluation**: Code reviews focusing on the effective use of data structures and performance analysis.

### 2. Collision Detection
- **Objective**: Design a container structure to manage a collection of bounding boxes to facilitate collision detection between game elements.
- **Method**:
  - Each game object (player, enemies, etc.) has a bounding box.
  - Collision detection logic efficiently checks interactions using these boxes.
- **Evaluation**: Testing to ensure accuracy and performance of collision detection.

## Development Plan

### 1. Initial Planning
- Define game mechanics and overall structure of the game level.
- Plan and design the bounding box system for collision detection.

### 2. Implementation Phase
- Implement Java Collections (`ArrayList`, `Stack`, or `Queue`) for managing images and game data.
- Create and integrate a collision detection system using bounding boxes.
- Implement rendering logic for game objects in a single-screen environment.

### 3. Testing and Refinement
- Conduct performance tests to ensure the bounding box system operates efficiently.
- Ensure that the game level responds correctly to collisions and interactions between objects.
